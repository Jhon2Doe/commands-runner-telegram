# Telegram Bot for Running Commands on Your Computer

This is a simple Telegram bot written in Python that allows you to run commands on your computer remotely through Telegram. The bot is built using the `python-telegram-bot` library and runs in a separate thread, enabling it to work concurrently with other tasks in your Python program.

**Note: Running commands remotely can be risky. Please use this bot responsibly and avoid granting access to unauthorized users.**

## Getting Started

To use this Telegram bot, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new Telegram bot by talking to [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram and obtain the API token.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

4. Replace `'YOUR_API_TOKEN'` in the Python script (`bot.py`) with the API token you obtained from BotFather.

5. Run the Python script using the command `python bot.py`.

## Prerequisites

To run the Telegram bot, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `python-telegram-bot` library

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-command-bot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd telegram-command-bot
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Replace `'YOUR_API_TOKEN'` in the `bot.py` script with the API token you obtained from BotFather.

## Usage

1. Run the bot by executing the following command:

```
python bot.py
```

2. Open Telegram and search for your bot (the one you created using BotFather).

3. Start a chat with the bot and use the available commands to interact with it.

## Available Commands

The bot supports the following commands:

- `/start`: Initializes the bot and displays a welcome message.
- `/help`: Provides information about the available commands.
- `/run <command>`: Runs the specified command on your computer and returns the output.

**Note: Be cautious when using the `/run` command, as running certain commands can have unintended consequences on your system.**

## Security Considerations

Running commands remotely can pose security risks. To ensure the safety of your system, consider the following:

- **Avoid sharing the bot API token**: Keep your bot API token private and do not expose it to others.
- **Limit bot access**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the bot.
- **Sanitize user inputs**: Validate and sanitize any user-provided commands before executing them to prevent code injection attacks.
